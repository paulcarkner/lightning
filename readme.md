# Lightning Maze Solver

A simple puzzle solver which generates random "walls" in a grid then finds the shortest route from the top-center cell to the bottom row. Numbers, colouring, and an async/await animation delay have been added to visualize the creation and solver algorithm.

Built using jQuery.
